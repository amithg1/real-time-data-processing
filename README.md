# real-time-data-processing
A real-time data processing pipeline that ingests streaming data, processes it, and stores it in an analytical warehouse.


ðŸ“Œ High-Level Workflow:

Python code (send_data.py) â†’ Sends real-time JSON data to AWS Kinesis Data Stream.
 
AWS Kinesis â†’ Streams real-time data to AWS Lambda.

AWS Lambda:
    Writes raw data into Amazon S3 (Landing Zone).
    Writes structured data into AWS RDS MySQL.

AWS S3 â†’ Stores JSON sensor data files.

Amazon EventBridge (S3 PutObject Event) â†’ Triggers another AWS Lambda Function.

This AWS Lambda Function â†’ Invokes AWS Step Function, which in-turn triggers AWS Glue job.

AWS Glue: Extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data into AWS Redshift.

AWS Redshift â†’ Stores processed data for analytics and querying.

#Not yet implemented
Amazon QuickSight / Athena â†’ Used for data visualization and analysis.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions â†’ Automates deployment of Lambda, Glue, and Step Function codes.
